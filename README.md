A curated arsenal of Python utilities, snippets, and whatnot.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using direnv (recommended)

```bash
# Install direnv if needed
brew install direnv

# Allow the direnv configuration for this directory
direnv allow .

# All environment variables and virtual env will be automatically loaded when you enter the directory
```

### Using Poetry

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install --no-root --with dev

# Activate the virtual environment (Poetry 2.0+)
poetry env activate

# To leave the virtual environment when done
deactivate

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Using Make

```bash
# Set up complete development environment
make setup

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t pyarsenal .

# Run with interactive shell
docker run -it pyarsenal
```

## üß∞ Development Tools

### Linting and Formatting

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Flake8**: Code linting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **mypy**: Type checking

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check code quality
make lint
```

### Security and Quality

- **Bandit**: Security scanning
- **Radon**: Code complexity analysis

```bash
# Run security checks
poetry run bandit -r . -x ./tests

# Check code complexity
poetry run radon cc . -a
```

### Testing

- **pytest**: Testing with coverage reporting

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make coverage
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

### Testing Actions Locally

You can test GitHub Actions locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install act (on macOS)
brew install act

# Run all workflows
act

# Run a specific workflow
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yaml

# Run a specific job
act -j test
```

1. **Code Quality**
   - Formatting checks with Black
   - Import ordering with isort
   - Linting with Flake8
   - Type checking with mypy
   - Security analysis with Bandit
   - Complexity analysis with Radon

2. **Testing**
   - Automated tests with pytest
   - Coverage reporting with pytest-cov
   - Coverage results uploaded to Codecov

3. **Build Validation**
   - Script compilation verification

The pipeline runs automatically on:
- Every push to the main branch
- All pull requests
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions interface
